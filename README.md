# Alien Jump! 🛸
This is a **Python + Pygame** educational project designed to teach programming basics through an interactive game.

## 🎮 Description
This project was created as part of an introductory programming course where I taught university students from different majors. 
By building a game in Python, students learned programming concepts on a fun and interactive way (At least that was the idea!).

> **Note:**  
> This is the **complete version** of the game.  
> During the course, students worked with a simplified version of the code containing incomplete sections, which we progressively built together while covering each programming concept.

## 🧠 Features
With this game I wanted to teach a solid foundation in basic programming principles.
- Object-oriented structure with multiple modules.  
- Input and Output handling.
- loops and conditionals
- functions and keyboard input.
- classes and methods.
- inheritance.
- global variables.
- Asteroids and outworld creatures!

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.13 (last verified in October 2025)  
- `pygame` library

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
Once the dependencies are installed, run:
```bash
python main.py
```
Or run it from your IDE.
